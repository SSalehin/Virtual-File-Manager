# Virtual File Manager

It's a GUI-based file manager application, made for the web.

In the lowest level, it uses a SPA-way of doing things. So,
*No refresh
*Use ajax to send and recieve data

To add a new component:
1. Create a folder of similar structure to Component/Sample
2. It takes care of script and style loading automatically. Just put them in the right folder.
3. Add @ComponentName in the div with id "components".

It needs some polish, but currently I'm getting busy with my Final Year Project. So, It's gonna have to be just it is now.
